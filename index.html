        Golfing is like a pizza, very sloppy and you hate yourself for consuming it. Here at the big slice, we will make you never want to play golf or eat pizza again. Our whole company began when our owner (pictured right) said, "golf". This would change the course of all mankind as we know

        Ever since that fateful day, we have been serving customers the most sloppy and greasy pizza's and snacks they could ever want. The best thing you could do here is order and then immediatly go to the bathroom. In fact, just give us your money and we will throw it away for you.
